    abstract = { BACKGROUND: Despite the availability of effective treatments, patients with asthma, regardless of severity, remain at risk of severe exacerbations resulting in significant burden to patients, the health care system, and insurance providers. OBJECTIVE: To examine severe exacerbations, treatment patterns, health care resource utilization (HCRU), and costs across all asthma severities. METHODS: In this retrospective study, patients aged 4 years and older filling 1 short-acting (β2-agonist (SABA) and at least 1 maintenance fill or at least 2 SABAs with or without maintenance fills were identified from administrative claims data from the IBM MarketScan Commercial and IBM MarketScan Multistate Medicaid Research databases (January 2010 to December 2017). Patients were indexed on a random SABA fill (2011-2016) and had 12 months of continuous eligibility pre-index and post-index. Patients were classified into Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) 2018 severity steps and by asthma control, as measured by SABA fill use in the 12 months pre-index: low (1 SABA fill per year), medium (2-3 SABA fills per year), and high (≥ 4 SABA fills per year); well controlled, not well controlled, and very poorly controlled, respectively. Severe asthma exacerbation events, health care costs, and asthma-related HCRU and costs were assessed relative to asthma severity and asthma control post-index. RESULTS: Of 1,005,522 patients, 50.3\% filled GINA Step 1; 19.7\% GINA Step 2; 10.9\% GINA Step 3; and 19.1\% GINA Steps 4-5 treatments. Overall, 953,337 severe exacerbation events occurred (approximately 0.95 events per patient), equating to 0.96, 0.67, 0.83, and 1.28 events per patient for patients filling GINA Step 1 through Steps 4-5, respectively. GINA Step 1 had the highest proportion of patients experiencing at least 1 event (57.0\%), followed by GINA Steps 4-5 (55.2\%), GINA Step 3 (45.0\%), and GINA Step 2 (41.9\%) treatments (P < 0.05). For GINA Step 1, 64.4\% of well-controlled patients experienced at least 1 exacerbation event vs 50.4\% of not well-controlled and 53.0\% of very poorly controlled patients (P < 0.05). For patients filling GINA Step 2-5 treatments, a greater proportion of very poorly controlled patients experienced at least 1 exacerbation event vs well-controlled patients (P < 0.05). The average total annual health care cost per patient was \$7,148 and total annual asthma-related costs were \$1,741. Each additional SABA fill was associated with a 26.0\%, 10.8\%, and 34.6\% increase in incidence of total exacerbations, all-cause costs, and asthma-related costs, respectively (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In this real-world database study, increased SABA fills and occurrence of exacerbations were correlated and associated with higher all-cause and asthma-related costs across all severities. New treatment paradigms, particularly for rescue therapies, are warranted to improve clinical and cost outcomes in these patients. DISCLOSURES: This analysis was funded by AstraZeneca.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Asthma-related outcomes are regularly used by studies to investigate the association between human exposure to landscape fire smoke and health. Robust summary effect estimates are required to inform health protection policy for fire smoke exposure.
OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the association between short-term exposure to landscape fire smoke (LFS) fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and asthma-related outcomes.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis following PRISMA guidelines. Four databases (PubMed, Medline, EMBASE and Scopus) and reference lists of recent fire smoke and health reviews were searched. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to evaluate the quality of case-crossover studies, and a previously validated quality assessment framework was used for observational studies lacking control groups. Publication bias was assessed using funnel plots and Egger's Test. The trim and fill method was used when there was evidence of publication bias. Sensitivity and influence analyses were conducted on all endpoints to test the robustness of estimates. Summary estimates were obtained for hospitalisations and emergency department (ED) visits. A descriptive analysis was conducted for physician visits, medication use, and salbutamol dispensations.
RESULTS: From an initial 181 articles (after duplicate removal), 20 studies were included for quantitative assessment and descriptive synthesis. LFS PM2.5 levels were positively associated with asthma hospitalisations (RR = 1.06, 95\% CI: 1.02-1.09) and emergency department visits (RR = 1.07, 95\% CI: 1.04-1.09). Subgroup analyses found that females were more susceptible than males for ED visits, and that there was an increasing association by age groups for hospital admissions and ED visits. High heterogeneity between studies was observed, but results were robust to sensitivity analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Females and all adults aged over 65 years appear to be the population groups most sensitive to asthma-related outcomes when exposed to LFS PM2.5. Overall, results were higher than those obtained for a typical PM2.5 mixture.},

abstract = {Exposure to biomass smoke has been associated with a wide range of acute and chronic health outcomes. Over the past decades, the frequency and intensity of wildfires has increased in many areas, resulting in longer smoke episodes with higher concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5). There are also many communities where seasonal open burning and residential wood heating have short- and long-term impacts on ambient air quality. Understanding the acute and chronic health effects of biomass smoke exposure requires reliable estimates of PM2.5 concentrations during the wildfire season and throughout the year, particularly in areas without regulatory air quality monitoring stations. We have developed a machine learning approach to estimate PM2.5 across all populated regions of Canada from 2010 to 2019. The random forest machine learning model uses potential predictor variables integrated from multiple data sources and estimates daily mean (24-hour) PM2.5 concentrations at a 5 km × 5 km spatial resolution. The training and prediction datasets were generated using observations from National Air Pollution Surveillance (NAPS) network. The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) between predicted and observed PM2.5 concentrations was 2.96 μg/m3 for the entire prediction set, and more than 96 % of the predictions were within 5 μg/m3 of the NAPS PM2.5 measurements. The model was evaluated using 10-fold, leave one-region-out, and leave-one-year-out cross-validations. Overall, CanOSSEM performed well but performance was sensitive to removal of large wildfire events such as the Fort McMurray interface fire in May 2016 or the extreme 2017 and 2018 wildfire seasons in British Columbia. Exposure estimates from CanOSSEM will be useful for epidemiologic studies on the acute and chronic health effects associated with PM2.5 exposure, especially for populations affected by biomass smoke where routine air quality measurements are not available.}
